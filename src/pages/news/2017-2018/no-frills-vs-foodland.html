Here in Mount Forest, there are only two grocery stores; No Frills and and Foodland. Each store has their own colour scheme, slogan, and policies; much like other grocery stores.
Both stores have a region that they specialize in. Today, all aspects of both franchises will be compared.

###Prices

Foodland has never been known for their crazy deals on grocery prices, but they are easily recognized for their well-run bakery, deli counter, and meat department. Foodland constantly has great deals, whether it’s regards to buying a cake for a special occasion, finding a nice selection of meat for a family camping trip, or even just a quick tasty dinner on the fly.

No Frills on the other hand is well-known for their great deals they on everyday grocery items. Whether it be toilet paper, fresh vegetables, or even arts and crafts, No Frills’ prices “Can’t be beat!”. Although, No Frills does not have a fresh deli or bakery.

###Location

Foodland is located right in the middle of Mount Forest on Main Street. The location of Foodland is yet another reason for their success. The location really helps the community as it is convenient being very close to the majority of the town. Granting all this, the parking lot is very small compared to the competitor.

No Frills is located just on the edge of Mount Forest across from TSC. This location is considered to be inconvenient to the town, although the deals and selection is the true decider between the stores. This being said, No Frills also provides a massive lot for all of your parking needs, and a gas bar for those last second fill-ups.

###Square Footage

The Foodland building has been in the grocery store business for quite some time. People often complain because of how small it is. Despite the fact, it makes the building feel cozy. This being said, the small store size may be a bit of a drawback for the company as it means less items, and less sales.

No Frills is thought to be a very clean and professional place to shop. The bright lights, and bright yellow colour scheme really make you feel elite. On top of that, No Frills is approximately two time the size of the competitor, which ultimately means more aisles, selection, and staff.

###Customer Service

When it comes to customer service, the Foodland employees really make you feel at home. The small store really makes it easy for the staff to direct you to what you are looking for, which ultimately leads to customers leaving happy and satisfied.

That being said, No Frills employees are identical. The staff is always there to assist you you with whatever need. Despite the store being so big, No Frills employees work as a team and help you find exactly what you are looking for to ensure customer satisfaction.

###Conclusion

All in all, both grocery stores are great. Although, they both excel in different places. That being said, hopefully this article will help you decipher which grocery store is best fit for your wants and needs.
