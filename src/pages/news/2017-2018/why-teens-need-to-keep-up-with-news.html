News comes in many forms and has evolved over the years to fit those forms, however with the surge of technology and unlimited access of the internet the news many people, students included intake can be skewed. In recent years applications such as Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook have strangely been the masses go to place for entertainment and 	personalized news feeds with many people ignoring credible sources like newspapers and television broadcasters which report a wide and very important news bulletins. This is a steadily growing epidemic that really needs to end, keeping up with important and worldly topics is something needs to be upheld in the future.


If you were following the news at the time of this article you would know that Russia has made a missile that can be sent overseas to America without being detected. This is very serious. However, when brought up in a class discussion no other student knew about this serious topic that could affect everyone. Many students feel helpless. Just having the knowledge of the event or tidbit of a story allows you to spread the word, discuss and debate. That's what we do with the news and that's how change happens but first you need the basic knowledge on the subject at hand.  If you followed the news youâ€™d also know that Doug Ford is leading in the PM polls for Ontario at 42.1% seemingly confirming that he is bound to win. Everything comes with pros and cons yet most students who are eligible to vote don't know that Ford wants to return minimum wage back to its regular prices instead of thirteen dollars an hour as well as changing up abortion policies making it harder for the procedures to be done as many other things that make him quite comparable to the President of the United States. Now I am not taking sides however once again this needs to be known to all Canadians because these are serious topics and policies that are essential to Ontario. It doesn't matter if you agree or disagree you just need to know when it comes time to go to the polls especially if this is your first time voting because your vote counts! That is if you follow the news and know when voting begins (June 7, 2018).


Following the news on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook should not be your main source of news and information due to the fact that the news feeds on those apps are tailored to your likes and hobbies.
